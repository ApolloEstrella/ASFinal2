Janpol,

Hi anak, first of all I want to thank God for giving us a good and Godly son. There are lot of times na I am silent
but that does not mean that I do not love you. I have personal issues that I am undergoing. I appreciate your performance
in school and your grades are improving. I am proud of you for being the assistant editor in chief and excited to see
the news letter to be published. I am happy to see your interest in playing guitar. Always be reminded that we love you
unconditionally. Sorry for there are times that I get mad with you. I will try my best to be a better daddy each day to show my love to you. Be open and talk to me if you have any concerns or personal problems, I am always here to listen and will not get mad but will understand you whatever it is. I will always be praying for wisdom and understanding for you and Apolline. Always pray to God all the time.

Love,
Daddy
